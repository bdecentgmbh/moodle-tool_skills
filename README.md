# Skills

Moodle admin tool plugin to manage skills

# Requirements

This plugin requires Moodle 4.x

# Motivation for this plugin

We believe that Moodle's competency system is too complex for many organisations. At the same time, just using course completions and badges is often not enough. With this plugin, organisations have a simple tool at their disposal to can manage skills across their moodle site.

# Installation

Install the plugin like any other plugin to folder /admin/tool/skills
See http://docs.moodle.org/en/Installing_plugins for details on installing Moodle plugins

# Quick start guide

Admins or users with the capability tool/skills:manage (by default given to managers) need to create skills under Site Administration > Plugins > Tools > Skills and make them available either globally or for specific course categories. 

Teachers (or users with the capability tool/skills:managecourseskillslist) can then manage skills in their course from the "Manage skills" page which is found in the secondary navigation of the course. From there, teachers can then enable specific skills and configure how many points students earn upon completion of the course.

# Moodle release support

This plugin is maintained for the two most recent major releases of Moodle as well as the most recent LTS release of Moodle. If you are running a legacy version of Moodle, but want or need to run the latest version of this plugin, you can get the latest version of the plugin, remove the line starting with $plugin->requires from version.php and use this latest plugin version then on your legacy Moodle. However, please note that you will run this setup completely at your own risk. We can't support this approach in any way and there is an undeniable risk for erratic behavior.

# Translating this plugin

This Moodle plugin is shipped with an english language pack only. All translations into other languages must be managed through AMOS (https://lang.moodle.org) by what they will become part of Moodle's official language pack.
