# Skills - Monitoring skills and learning time

## Overview

The "Skills" feature is designed to enhance learner engagement within Moodle. As a tool-type plugin, Skills facilitates the awarding of skills based on points. Learners can acquire skills by completing linked courses or activities, fostering a sense of achievement and progress.

The "Skills" feature allows administrators and teachers to configure up to 10 levels for each skill. Each level corresponds to a specific set of points, creating a structured progression system. This system enhances the granularity of skill development and provides learners with clear milestones to achieve.

This documentation provides an in-depth guide to the various aspects and functionalities of the Skills feature.
